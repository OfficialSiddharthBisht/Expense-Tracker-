EXPENSE TRACKER
Expense Tracker:
Your app should have a form which has 3 input boxes
Month
income
expense
Take input of all the above fields from user
Note that all the input fields should be wrapped around a form, so make sure you follow relevant steps related to form submit.
On clicking on form submit, display all the data in form of cards
Each card should have month, income, expense and savings (income - expenses)
Each row should have 4 cards, use Grid
Bonus :
Your cards should be persisted even after page refresh ( hint:use localStorage)

Note: First complete the functionality of app and then go for CSS, CSS has less weightage for this evaluation
